   - Add the video title, thumbnail reference, brief description, and link to the full article
   - Maintain consistent formatting with existing entries
   - Ensure the YouTube URL is properly linked in the overview

3. **Internal Linking Strategy:**

   - Link to related marketing blueprints in /blueprints/ (Google Ads, SEO, Meta, Klaviyo)
   - Connect to relevant service pages in /services/
   - Reference applicable tools in /tools/ (ROAS calculator, CPA calculator)
   - Link to location-specific marketing pages in /marketing/ when geographically relevant
   - Ensure all internal links use relative paths and follow Next.js routing conventions

   - Follow 2-space indentation
   - Use kebab-case for file names
   - Ensure all components are properly exported
   - Include proper metadata for SEO (title, description)

6. **YouTube Embed Format:**
   ```jsx
   <div className="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 mb-8">
     <iframe 
       src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/[VIDEO_ID]"
       title="[Video Title]"
       allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
       allowFullScreen
     />
   </div>
   ```
