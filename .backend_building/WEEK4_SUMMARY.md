### 4. WebSocket Real-time Features

**Server** (`/src/lib/socket/server.js`)
- Socket.io server with authentication
- User-specific rooms
- Admin dashboard room
- Real-time event emitters:
  - Article generation updates
  - Activity log notifications
  - Analytics updates
  - System alerts

**Client Hooks** (`/src/hooks/useSocket.js`)
- `useSocket()` - Base socket connection
- `useDashboardSocket()` - Dashboard updates
- `useArticleSocket()` - Article generation status
- `useSystemAlerts()` - System notifications

### 5. Enhanced Audit Logging

**Audit System** (`/src/lib/audit.js`)
- Comprehensive action types
- Batch processing for performance
- Real-time notifications for important events
- Query interface for audit trails
- User activity summaries
- System activity reports

**Features**:
- Immediate logging for critical actions
- Queued logging for non-critical events
- Auto-flush on queue size
- WebSocket integration for live updates

### 6. Queue Dashboard

**Dashboard Utilities** (`/src/lib/queue/dashboard.js`)
- Queue statistics
- Job monitoring
- Failed job retry
- Queue pause/resume
- Queue health checks
- Job removal and cleanup

**API Endpoint** (`/src/app/api/queues/stats/route.js`)
- Protected endpoint for queue statistics
- Health status monitoring

## Technical Implementation

### Redis Configuration
```javascript
const redisConfig = {
  host: process.env.REDIS_HOST || 'localhost',
  port: process.env.REDIS_PORT || 6379,
  maxRetriesPerRequest: null,
  enableReadyCheck: false
};
```

### Job Queue Options
- Keep last 100 completed jobs
- Keep last 50 failed jobs
- 3 retry attempts
- Exponential backoff (2s delay)

### WebSocket Authentication
- JWT token verification
- User-specific rooms
- Admin broadcast capabilities

### Audit Log Categories
- Authentication events
- Content management
- Article operations
- Settings changes
- System events
- Analytics exports

## Environment Variables Added
```env
# Redis
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# WebSocket
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `/src/lib/queue/config.js` - Queue configuration
2. `/src/lib/queue/processors/articleProcessor.js` - Article jobs
3. `/src/lib/queue/processors/analyticsProcessor.js` - Analytics jobs
4. `/src/lib/queue/processors/cleanupProcessor.js` - Cleanup jobs
5. `/src/lib/queue/scheduler.js` - Cron jobs
6. `/src/lib/queue/dashboard.js` - Queue monitoring
7. `/src/lib/socket/server.js` - WebSocket server
8. `/src/lib/audit.js` - Audit logging system
9. `/src/hooks/useSocket.js` - Socket client hooks
10. `/src/app/api/queues/stats/route.js` - Queue stats API

## Integration Points

### With Week 2 APIs
- Article generation uses queue system
- Analytics tracking triggers real-time updates
- Settings changes logged to audit trail

### With Week 3 Frontend
- Real-time notifications in dashboard
- Article generation status updates
- Live activity feed updates

## Performance Optimizations
- Batch audit log processing
- Queue-based async operations
- WebSocket for real-time updates (no polling)
- Cleanup jobs for data maintenance

## Security Features
- WebSocket authentication required
- Audit trail for all actions
- IP tracking for security events
- Failed login monitoring

## Monitoring Capabilities
- Queue health checks
- Job failure tracking
- System alerts via WebSocket
- Comprehensive audit queries

## Next Steps (Week 5)
- Add Redis caching layer
- Implement CSRF protection
- Optimize database queries
- Setup monitoring (Sentry)
- Add refresh tokens
- Performance optimization

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test job retry mechanism
2. Verify scheduled tasks execution
3. Test WebSocket reconnection
4. Verify audit log completeness
5. Test queue failure scenarios

## Notes
- Redis required for job queues (install locally or use cloud service)
- WebSocket server needs to be initialized with HTTP server
- Scheduled jobs need to be started on app initialization
- Audit logs provide compliance-ready tracking

The system now has enterprise-level features including background job processing, real-time updates, comprehensive audit logging, and automated maintenance tasks.
